    "\n",
    "The first step to working with an SPM image is to import it. Nanoscopy currently relies on other packages to load the SPM image data from files. When the data has been loaded from a file, Nanoscopy stores the data for future use in a special data container, called \"SPMImage\", which is defined in the Nanoscopy package itself. This data container stores the different data channels contained in the SPM image file, as well as important metadata from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Importing data\n",
    "SPM data importing in Nanoscopy makes use of the \"io\" module in the \"spm\" subpackage. This module contains a convenience function which will attempt to load the data from its file based on the file extension as long as the extension is one that is recognized by the importing algorithm. The function is called \"read\". The read function can take either the path of a file to be loaded or the path to a directory of files to be loaded. Regardless, the read function always returns a list of SPMImage items, with one item per file loaded.\n",
